# Code Streak Tracker

**Code Streak Tracker** is a simple VS Code extension that helps you track your daily coding streak. Each day you open VS Code and code, the extension will log your progress, motivate you to keep going, and display your consecutive coding days. Miss a day? Your streak resets!

## Features

- Automatically tracks how many consecutive days you've opened VS Code and coded.
- Shows a message with your current streak each time you open your editor.
- Encourages you to keep your streak alive with motivating notifications.

## How it Works

1. When you open VS Code, Code Streak Tracker checks if you've coded today.
2. If you've coded on consecutive days, it increases your streak.
3. If you miss a day, your streak resets, and you start fresh!

## Installation

1. Install the extension from the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/).
2. Once installed, the extension will activate each time you open VS Code.

## Commands

- **Show Coding Streak**: See your current coding streak by using the `Show Coding Streak` command.

## Key Features in Future Versions

- Add a status bar indicator to show your streak at a glance.
- Integrate with Git to track streaks based on commits.
- Track hours coded per day.
